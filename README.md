# GAIH-CASE-MODEL-ANALYSIS-VISIUALIZATION
 data visiualization and analysis with use Power BI
Firstly, I displayed the data via Power Pivot and Power Query using excel.   
Then I determined the “missing “or “null” values in this data.  
After that, I eliminated this data if there are the same values and they meet.  
In addition, there were negative values at some points, I converted these values to positive and saved them.  
After saving, I opened the Power BI program and reviewed my data again, deleted the repeated data (id_numbers, sutün1 etc.) and unnecessary data. Thus, I ensured the data integrity and saved it. 
At the modeling stage, I chose the common tables as a priority and decided to model them. 
One of the most important aspects at the modeling stage is to provide convenience to the user, so the model I will create should be easy and understandable. 
I have modeled my data in the following way where it displays illiterate people in 4 districts. 
In addition to this model, you can see total population in districts.
